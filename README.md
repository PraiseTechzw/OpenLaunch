> A collaborative innovation lab where developers, designers, and creators build real-world software in public.

## What is OpenLaunch?

OpenLaunch is an open-source launchpad and incubator designed to foster collaborative innovation through our annual Coding Party initiative. We're not building a single app—we're creating a platform where the global developer community can come together to build multiple real-world products that matter.

### Our Mission

To democratize software innovation by providing a transparent, inclusive, and structured environment where ideas transform into production-ready solutions through collective effort.

## Why Join the Party?

- **Open by Default**: Every decision, every line of code, every design choice is transparent
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear onboarding, mentorship, and learning opportunities
- **Expert-Respectful**: Leverage the wisdom of experienced contributors
- **Real Impact**: Build software that solves actual problems
- **Community-First**: Decisions made collectively, benefits shared by all
